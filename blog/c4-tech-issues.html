      I was considering blogging about cybersecurity when I happened to see on the nightly news that just a few days ago, <a href = "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/health-insurer-anthem-hit-by-hackers/"> Anthem a major health insurance company, was hacked. </a> The company had to warn as many as 80 million people that their personal information may be stolen. This security breach is an example of what I see as an increasingly more dangerous outcomes from cyber attacks. Since the 1990s, identity theft has been a concern for anyone who uses the Internet. Fortunately, most cases could resolve with just a simple call to the credit card company. As technology and the Internet has been used for services even more vital than money, however, cybersecurity becomes even more important. Specifically, as devices that have non-digital, tangible effects become connected to the Internet, risks grow stronger.

      Smart devices now include the iRobot Roomba, an automated vacuum cleaner, and the Nest Thermostat, a thermostat that allows the user to control the temperature of her home from her home anywhere on the Internet. While the risks of these items being hacked might be actually be laughable (what are the real dangers of a rogue vacuum cleaner or an overheated house?), they may be less funny when other important devices becomes smart. Healthcare is seeing a rapid growth of smart devices. For example, Medtronic’s Smart Guard system actually delivers amount of insulin based on glucose levels that are transmitted wirelessly to a small computers. A breach of security that alters how such a system performs could be extremely dangerous to a patient. Insulin overload could cause hypoglycemia, which could result in seizures, unconsciousness, or even death. Similarly, autonomous cars face could face such risks. When I tell many people how excited I am about self-driving cars, about how convenient they could be and how many lives they could save, they respond with the fear that the driving computer could be suddenly altered by a hacker. Perhaps, they say, a systems breach could result in your car driving full speed at the nearest wall.

      The Roomba, the Nest, the Medtronic’s Smart Guard, and autonomous cars all have two things in common. They have wireless connectivity and immediate, tangible ramifications with no human to check their actions. Unlike a system that simply monitors heart rate wirelessly or a GPS, they actually change the physical world directly. A systems breach for such devices could create immediate danger. This is why cybersecurity will become an even more important challenge in the coming decades. Smart devices will control locks, fire-stopping sprinklers, cars, medical devices, and items we have not yet imagined. The dangers that a cyber attack could create will be greater than ever, and as a result, consumers may be reluctant to buy devices that could drastically improve the quality of their lives. It will be up to those in the tech industry to find creative solutions to ensure that such devices will remain safe from security breaches in a world where cyber attacks are unlikely to stop.
