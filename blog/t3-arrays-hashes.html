  <h1>Arrays and Hashes</h1>

  <h2>What good are arrays and hashes?</h2>

  <h4>February 1, 2015</h4>

    <p>Arrays and hashes are two types of objects in Ruby capable of holding large amounts of data. We will start by examining arrays.
    </p>

    <p>Arrays are collections of Ruby objects. For example, an array “x”, might look like:
    </p>
      <code>x = [2, 5, 200000, 4, 1]</code>
      <code>y=[“Jim”, “Tammy”, “Nancy”, “Bob”]</code>
      <code>z=[“hello”, 2.003, 4, “word”, z]</code>

    <p>There are several different ways to create arrays. One can use…</p>
    <code>x = Array.new</code> <p>to create an empty array. Or:</p>
    <code>x = [1,3,6,2,1]</code> <p>to create the specified array.</p>

    <break>

    <p>Hashes are similar to arrays, except that each object in a hash also has another object corresponding with it. For example, if one ran a store and wanted to associate each item for sale with a price, one could create a hash:</p>
    <code>items = [“8 pack of hot dogs” ==> 4;“1lb bananas” ==>10;“Tootsie Roll” ==>.05]
  </code>

</main>
