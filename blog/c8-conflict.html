    <p>One conflict I had was working as a sailing instructor. At the time, I had three different supervisors for that job, one of them who actually worked on the water with us. One time, when we were sailing back to the docks, many of my students were sailing through an area known as the “channel.” In a distance audible to a lot of my students, my supervisor chastised me about how the students should not come back through the channel. I was unfamiliar with that policy, and I said something snarky in return. Later, in a talk with some of our other bosses, he accused me of insubordination.</p>
    <p>I think the reason I was so upset was that I felt like my supervisor making me look unknowledgeable in the students. I think I felt embarrassed to not have been enforcing a policy I probably should have. I also felt angry at the tone he used when telling me what I was doing wrong. I am guessing he felt like the staff who worked below him did not listen to him, but rather only listened to the other, more higher-ranking supervisors.</p>
    <p>I did not take much action to resolve the conflict. All I did was talk to my other supervisors about the problem (who, in turn, were his supervisors.) I think I was in a pattern of being passive-aggressive with that supervisor. </p>
    <p>If I could go back, I would not have made a snarky comment. I would have talked to that supervisor, face-to-face and in private, about how I felt. I would have asked him if he could try correct me not in front of my students, but rather in private. I would have told him that I did not like the tone he spoke to me in. I also think there was tension building throughout that summer, and had I talked with him about it earlier, that tension could have been lessened.</p>
    <p>Reconsidering the conflict, I realize that it is best to be open and honest about your feelings as soon as possible. It was not good that we both were going to another supervisor to figure with our frustrations. I could have told him face-to-face, and in private, about how I was feeling.</p>
