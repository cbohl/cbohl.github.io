  <h1>Dev Bootcamp Fireside Reaction</h1>
  <h2>My thoughts on DBC Culture</h2>
  <h4>Today's Date</h4>

      Shereef’s fireside chat made me even more excited about integrating myself into the Dev Bootcamp culture. Probably the most important part to me was Shereef’s insistence on the fact that DBC students develop a cooperative culture, rather than a competitive one. In past classes and work experiences, I have seen clashes of egos that slow down progress for all parties involved. When people are unwilling to show their vulnerability, they continuously try to pretend to understand something they do not. Inevitably, this gap in knowledge comes back to haunt them. Oftentimes, I have found myself, due to my own insecurity, unwilling to show my ignorance. I feel confident that DBC will be a safe place to say “I don’t know.”

        Similarly, I think DBC’s emphasis on teaching and learning within the student body is a neat emphasis rarely seen in education. In order to have these style, however, the students must be comfortable with themselves and not be constantly trying to prove their programming knowledge to others. I am also excited about this because I have often found myself in my element when teaching in the past—I taught sailing lessons for a few summers and I have tutored students in math and English as a second language. I look forward to being able to do some teaching, but I also know I will certainly be more in the role of the learner throughout DBC.

        I also appreciated, but was also made a little bit nervous by, Shereef’s insistence on bringing the “whole self” to DBC. Both in work and school, I often fear that my beliefs, reservations, or feelings are not relevant, and I do not speak up. Thus, it will be a challenge for me to bring my “whole self” to DBC, but Shereef’s insistence makes me more confident that I can speak my mind.

      I will also admit that I am a little nervous about keeping up with the 24/7 culture of Twitter and other social media. I do not like to be glued to my phone all the time. Also, I will admit to being intimidated sometimes by the number of followers that others have on Twitter or the number of contacts they have on LinkedIn. However, I realize that while developing a network is important, these are not things to become stressed about and they will develop over time.

      Overall, I like the attitude of people involved with DBC and its innovative attitude toward education. I have to guess that coding bootcamps and other innovational education will begin to change traditional education, too. (As an aside, one thing I really appreciated when I visited Dev Bootcamp was the absence of the constant questioning of where or if you went to college. I think this shows a belief that anyone can be a productive coder, so long as they believe in what they are doing and put effort into it.) To conclude, I’m looking forward to more DBC!
