  <h2>An interesting finding in psychology and how it effects Dev Bootcamp</h2>

  <p>Stereotype threat refers to a phenomenon found by psychologists that the knowledge and acceptance of negative stereotypes can effect a person’s performance on a task. The most famous study on stereotype threat was done in 1995 by Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson. In the control group, black and white students took a GRE exam and were told it was simply a problem-solving exercise. In the experimental group, the students were told the test would show underlying cognitive ability. While black and white students performed about evenly in the control group, white students significantly outperformed black students in the experimental group. The test, the psychologists asserted, showed that stereotypes about the intellectual limitations of blacks hindered their performance.</p>
  <p>Since Steele and Aronson’s study, hundreds of similar studies have confirmed the existence of stereotype. Yet they also showed stereotype threat is not limited to effecting African-Americans on verbal exams. It effects Latinos in academics. It effects women in math, negotiations, and chess. It even effects white men when faced with the idea of Asian male superiority in math.</p>
  <p>As a white male, I do not feel I have really felt the hard outcomes of stereotype threat. The closest I think I have really come to is one time when I took a college physics course, and I started to stress-out that all of the other students, who were mostly physics majors, whereas I was not, were more math and science types than me.</p>
  <p>Stereotype threat is clearly relevant in the software world, because it is dominated by white and Asian men. Even at Dev Bootcamp, which emphasizes diversity and offers scholarships to women and racial minorities, reflects the divide. In our cohort, fourteen of the seventeen students are males, and the vast majority of students are white. I am not entirely sure how I would help someone who I perceived as experiencing stereotype threat. Perhaps I could show them that I have confidence in their abilities. I could avoid trying to take a dominant position or becoming overbearing when pair programming.</p>
  <p>One article we read also suggested that stereotype threat also helped explain why African-Americans who have often do not have as much success as their white peers with equally high test scores. In the 1990s, the African-American college dropout rate was 20% - 25% higher than the white dropout rate.</p>
  <p>While I think stereotype threat explains part of the difference, I also think that a lack of a sense of belongingness also explains these differences. It is hard to be successful if you are suddenly surrounded by people you perceive as completely different than you and unaccepting of you. College can be especially like this because you move away from your roots and you’re engulfed in the world of college. In academics especially, if you do not feel as comfortable asking people questions, you may struggle to succeed. I have not felt that way in a racial sense, but I have been in places where I do not feel I belong, and struggled as a result.</p>
  <p>That is where I think I can definitely have an impact at Dev Bootcamp. I think I can try to be equally open to interacting with those who are not white males. It will probably be tempting for me to just spend my time with other white males who are in their 20s, but I can try to be open to becoming as close with everyone.</p>
  <p>As an aside, the Steele and Aronson 1995 study also reminded me of the fixed vs. growth mindset. In the control group, the students were effectively told that the test was an indicator of cognitive ability, something that could be seen as permanent. This was shown to have hazardous effects on people who believed that they belonged to a group that was inferior by nature. The results of the study prove, however, that having a more growth-based mindset can allow you to see past your predispositions, whether they be about your race, gender, or just yourself.</p>
