    <p>I strongly value compassion. I think it is not always easy or natural to try to imagine how someone else is feeling, but if you do it can be very enlightening. I don’t mean compassion for just the suffering. I think having compassion for everyone in your day-to-day life can help you build stronger and healthier relationships.</p>
    <p>I try to be compassionate when it comes to someone telling me about a problem. The most recent time someone told me about a problem was in regards to a relationship issue. I actually tend to avoid giving advice. I actually find that what I usually want when I’m telling someone about a problem of mine is just for them to listen and understand. So that is what I tend to do, just listen. Only if I feel I completely understand what the other person is going through, if I understand their unique desires, emotions, and needs, if I have had a similar experience, if I know I am particularly knowledgeable about the subject, and if I know my advice cannot lead them down a dangerous path, then, and only then, am I willing to give advice. I think this is actually the most compassionate way to help someone else with their problems.</p>
    <p>Compassion has clear implications when it comes to stereotype threat. I think if we lived in a more compassionate world, these false stereotypes may never have been created. If rather than jumping to the conclusion, “women are bad at math”, more people had considered what it was like to be a woman compared to a man over the last several centuries, they might reach some enlightenment.</p>
    <p>In terms of more actively combatting stereotype threat at Dev Bootcamp, I think compassion can allow one to see when someone is struggling with stereotype threat. When someone makes this observation, there are two ways of helping. First, one can openly question whether someone is struggling with stereotype threat and help that person challenge their negative thoughts. The problem with this method is that it may be uncomfortable to bring up or you might just be unsure if stereotype threat is actually the issue someone is dealing with. The other method, then, is to just help foster confidence. I think the driver/navigator boundaries are very important for fostering confidence. Without the boundaries, I find that someone tends to take too much power and become a “backseat driver” or a “rogue driver”. These boundaries make sure both parties are developing in their programming knowledge and developing confidence.</p>
    <p>Writing about my values feels challenging but worthwhile. While these are things I may think about often, they are not something I usually put on paper. I recognize that at some point I may feel down at Dev Bootcamp. I am nervous about moving to a new city and suddenly having such busy days and being surrounded by so many people. I think during times I feel down, it will be important to make connections with the people around me. Also, I will know that I will be able to call good friends and family. Otherwise, I think it’s important to know how to relax. I can do this by taking a long shower or watching Netflix.</p>
