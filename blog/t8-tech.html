    <p>As students at Dev Bootcamp, the first language I familiarized myself with was Ruby, which was a wonderful, super coder-friendly, high-level language. However, I could complete Dev Bootcamp and still have a shallow understanding of how a language like Ruby actually makes a computer store information and display text and images on the computer. I knew that that computers operate, and have almost always operated in binary language. This means that everything a computer does and stores uses bits, which are each a 1 or a 0. The question remains, however, how does a language that reads like this:</p>

 <h6 class = input_line>Ruby source code:</h6>
    <pre class = input_codeblock><code>
if fav_team == "Milwaukee Bucks"
  puts "That's a great team."
else
  puts "That's a good team, but I prefer the Bucks."
end
    </code></pre>

    <p>get changed to something that reads like this?</p>

    <h6 class = output_line>Machine language:</h6>
    <code> <pre class = output_codeblock>
100011010110100110011010
    </code></pre>

    <p>First, one must understand that the former is called source-code. Source-code is the code written by programmers of any high-level language (like C, Ruby, and Java.) The latter, binary, is called machine language.</p>

    <p>Ruby is an Object-Oriented language, and therefore fits at the top of the diagram. Ruby uses an interpreter, which is a computer program that translates the code into machine language as it runs.</p>

    <p>Many languages use compilers, meaning they use a translator to convert the source code to machine language code. Then, they run.</p>

    <p>This leaves the question, how what is the actual physical difference between a 1 and a 0? 1 and 0 are actually mathematical abstraction for two different physical states. It is like on-and-off on a high switch. On hard drives it has to do with whether something is magnetic or less magnetic. On a processor it relates to whether a transistor has high or low voltage.</p>

    <p>On very early computers, electromechanical switches called relays determined bits. This means that you could actually see whether it was a 1 or a 0 based on the position of the swtich. Then, in the mid-20th century, the current in a vacuum tube determined the value of a bit. However, because it would take hundreds of relatively large vacuum tubes to build a computer, eventually more advanced hardware was built.</p>

    <p>This description of how a computer language actually make changes on a computer could go much deeper. But this provides a basic understanding to the beginning programmer how what she works on makes the computer perform actions.</p>
