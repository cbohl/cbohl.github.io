  <h2>Why Pairing Accelerates Learning and What I've Learned from Feedback</h2>

    <p> Pair programming is an important part of the Dev Bootcamp curriculum and it is really one of the main reasons I chose Dev Bootcamp over a similar program. I love collaboration. When I play sports, I like team sports—like flag football or basketball. When I play video games, I love co-op. I like developing an understanding of how my teammates think and learning how to bring out the best in them. As expected, pair programming has been my favorite part of Dev Bootcamp thus far. I find myself to be the most productive when pairing because communicating with someone else keeps my mind on task. I find that I learn at a faster rate when pairing, because when someone else drives, I learn lots of cool programming tricks. Pairing has also allowed me to learn to work with a variety of people. I have worked with people from places I have never been, like Long Island, New York and with people from places I have spent the majority of my life, like the midwest. For example, by pure coincidence, I even paired with an alum of my high school!</p>
    <p>The most surprising thing in pairing has been how vulnerable others have been when pairing. In school and college, I always felt like I was in a battle to show off my knowledge and prove myself. But the majority of my Dev Bootcamp partners have been so willing to say “I don’t know” or “I’m not really good at this” that I feel no need to mask my lack of knowledge in certain areas. One time, my partner tried to explain something to me, and my mind was somewhere else entirely. I said, candidly, “Sorry, I just completely zoned out”, and she was very accepting and understanding. The great thing about showing this vulnerability is not only does it make both partners feel much more at ease, but it also creates a much more efficient dynamic. When someone feels the need to prove herself, she can slow the pair down by faking her way through code. Then, when a bunch of errors stack up, the pair has to work backwards to figure out what went wrong. When she is willing to admit that she does not understand, however, the partners can just look to the documents or discuss, so that the errors are not created in the first place.</p>
    <p>My most frustrating experiences have been when proper navigator and driver roles have not been established. I find that this usually happens when my partner really wants to get through the challenge quickly, and I become passive and do not remind them of the pairing is caring regulations. Then, either one of two things happens. The driver starts to self-navigate, leaving the navigator to stand idly by, losing track of what is going on. Otherwise, the navigator starts to back-seat-drive, telling the programmer the exact syntax of what to type in, and leaving the driver feeling like a typist.</p>
    <p>My favorite moments have been when I’m working with someone and the rspec tests are failing due to a small error. Then, one of us finds the mistake, and suddenly all the tests pass and we have completed a really complex challenge. It is a great feeling of mutual success.</p>
    <p>My initial reaction from feedback is to feel really good when the feedback is positive and really down when the feedback is negative or constructive. My biggest challenge in receiving feedback has been not becoming too emotionally attached to someone else’s approval. Fortunately, I think that the A.S.K. (Actionable, Specific, and Kind) requirements for feedback really prevent peers from giving feedback that really inflates or deflates self-esteem. Someone saying “I think you need to take more time to review the Ruby docs” is a lot easier to palate than “You are just awful with CSS.” I also think that we received good advice in Phase 0 prep suggesting that we should avoid comparisons between people. If someone tells you, “I think you are the best student in our cohort”, that may feel good for a moment, but you may also feel the continuous pressure of being “the best” for the rest of Dev Bootcamp and beyond.</p>
    <p>The feedback I have received has been useful. One trend in my feedback is that I tend to really want to get a problem done quickly, so I either fail to take a step back and look at the bigger picture or I fail to really examine the Ruby Docs. I think Ruby is special because it has so many convenient methods for completing tasks in just a line or two of code. It takes a lot of patience, though, to find that these methods exist at all and to find their proper syntax. It is usually worth it, though, because once you learn these methods, you will use them repeatedly in the future. I will make a continued effort to try to understand the Ruby docs.</p>
    <p>Writing feedback always takes a lot more time than I expect. It is challenging to make feedback meet the A.S.K. requirements. I usually find that it is not too difficult to find positive feedback, but oftentimes I have such a good experience with a partner that I cannot think of anything constructive. Other times, I struggle to give constructive feedback because I worry about hurting my partner’s feelings, or that my criticism really is not warranted.</p>
    <p>To sum it up, I think pair programming has really accelerated my learning of programming, but even more importantly, it has helped me develop interpersonal and intrapersonal skills. I am learning how to express myself when I do not agree with the direction someone else is going. I am learning to give useful and sensitive feedback to others. I am learning to speak my mind when I feel marginalized. I am learning the importance of not invading someone else’s domain of work. I am learning to be honest and vulnerable when I do not understand something or I have made a mistake. In addition to this all, pair programming is allowing me to make meaningful connections with a diverse group of people.</p>
