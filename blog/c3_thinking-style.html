  <h2>Gregorc Thinking Styles and Growth vs. Fixed Mindsets</h2>
  <br>
  <h4>February 1, 2015</h4>

  <section>

    <p>The Gregorc’s Mind Styles model looks at two different qualities that people tend to have in the way they think. The first is abstract vs. concrete: Abstract thinkers tend to look for deeper, hidden meanings found through intuition, whereas concrete thinkers prefer that which can be perceived through the senses. The second is random vs. sequential: Random thinkers tend to solve problems through guessing and often work out of order, whereas sequential thinkers prefer to take things in the order that is generally considered the natural and linear way.
    </p>

    <p>
      My scores on the Gregorc’s Mind Styles test were as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>6 Concrete Sequential</li>
      <li>8 Abstract Sequential</li>
      <li>11 Abstract Random</li>
      <li>5 Concrete Random</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Thus, the test showed that I have a strong preference for the abstract (19:11) and a slight preference for the random (16:14).
    </p>

    <p>
      I have found that some expectations for an abstract random thinker to fit my personality and some not to. The most true has been the suggestion that I like “establishing healthy relationships with others” and “bringing harmony to group situations.” I have usually been the one in my group to really focus in on the “Pairing is Caring” requirements, including checking in on feelings and making sure that each partner is properly engaged in the driver and navigator roles (sometimes I think to the point where my partner sees it as too much of a focus). When I feel like something is out-of-place in regards to the emotional side of things, I can get really distracted and unable to keep my mind on the code. This model would also explain my biggest struggle: working alone. According to the model, an abstract random thinker excels in groups.

      Some things that have not been true are “working best when giving broad or general guidelines.” My favorite tasks so far have been the Ruby exercises, which have very specific requirements to programming in order to get the test to pass. When given the task such as move the boxes in a creative way or create your own website, I have sometimes slowed down and gotten a little flustered. Another aspect that I found in myself that did not neatly fit “abstract random” was that I tend to prefer just trying to make things work and programming to ready documents.
    </p>

    <p>
      All of these observations would tend to suggest that I actually have a lower preference for abstract over concrete, and have a stronger preference for random over sequential. There are many ways for me to play to my strengths and work with my weaknesses. One thing I can continue to do is pair—I have never paired more than the required amount, but it might be smart to do so, because I usually find these sessions to be the most productive engaging.  Another thing I can do is make sure I get the more open ended tasks done by breaking them into smaller blocks. I have had success sometimes by just writing down what I need to do to finish a week’s work, and I could do something similar for the more open ended tasks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, after reviewing the “fixed vs. growth mindset” work, I can realize that my thinking style is not necessarily set in stone. If I practice reading the documentation more, I may start to not dislike the reading part as much. As I continue to pair more often, I may increase my confidence in myself and I might find myself not becoming overly distracted by small details in my relationship with my partner in pairing.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a couple of feedbacks, I have been told that I tend to be a little to aggressive when it comes to coding—approaching “thrashing” and not stopping and thinking. Here, again, I think that this tendency is noteworthy, but I think I can be more cognizant in the future of when to step back and look at the bigger picture.
