    <p>Working on my website takes serious time! I find that making things look the way I want using CSS takes lots of careful adjustments. I have not tried using Jekyll or Bootstrap, but perhaps those could expedite the process.</p>
    <p>I really had no idea where to start in terms of making an aesthetically pleasing homepage, so I looked at a website full of personal pages to get some ideas. I am still searching for a good black-and-white photo to use as a background, but for now I am just using a picture of a laptop I found online.</p>
    <p>I was never one to be very good at drawing. I think the visual part of designing a website may not be my favorite, but I am going to try to keep an open mind. </p>
    <p>There are still many weaknesses to my website. But I intend to keep working at it.</p>
