  <h2>My first impressions of git, GitHub, and building a website!</h2>

      Wow! I've built a website already in my first week of DBC. That's super cool. I once tried to follow a tutorial on building a Ruby on Rails based website, and although I learned a lot from the experience, it was much more difficult without all of the Dev Bootcamp material.

      I can already imagine how git will be extremely useful in future projects. Git allows developers to save their progress at a moment in time--video game style. This is called version control. If developers later find that they have created a bug or made any kind of mistake, they can go "back in time." By simply using the "git log" command in UNIX (UNIX is the language that Terminal uses in Mac. Terminal allows you to control your computer through typing in commands, rather than using the Graphical User Interface that most people use.), one can see all commits made in the past, and choose to go back to any of them.

      GitHub is simply a website that allows programmers to push their code, and all of the git saved changes that go with it, online. This way, not only can they access it from another computer, but other programmers can access the code as well. In group projects, this becomes extremely useful, because then multiple programmers can make changes to a project, all from different computers. Typically, programmers will make "pull requests" to an administrator. That way, all changes can be looked at by someone in charge before the change is made.

      There's a lot of git I still don't completely understand, but I'm looking forwarding to working at it more!
